# Trace Function Library

A streamlined plugin offering a complete set of Blueprint-callable trace and sweep functions tailored for FPS, third-person, and RTS games in Unreal Engine 5.4+. This library removes boilerplate tracing logic and adds debug-friendly, flexible alternatives to standard line, sweep, and visibility checks.

## ðŸ”§ Installation

1. Purchase or download the plugin from the Fab Marketplace.
2. Open your Unreal project and go to `Edit > Plugins`.
3. Locate the **Trace Function Library** and enable it.
4. Restart the editor to finalize activation.

## ðŸš€ How To Use

Using the Trace Function Library is simple and modular. All functions are **Blueprint-callable** and grouped under the category:

> **Trace Function Library**

### âœ… Quick Start (Blueprint)

1. Open any Blueprint (e.g., a character, controller, or utility BP).
2. Right-click in the graph and search for any trace function.
3. Look under the **Trace Function Library** category in the context menu.

5. Connect your desired input parameters (e.g., controller, trace distance, shape, etc.).
6. Toggle `bDrawDebug` to visualize the trace results during gameplay.

## ðŸ“š Function Overview

| **Function**                    | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `TraceFromCameraByType`        | Performs a line trace from the playerâ€™s perspective (FPS, third-person, or RTS).|
| `SphereTraceFromCameraByType`  | Same as above, but uses a sphere shape for broader hit detection.              |
| `LineTraceMultiFromCamera`     | Multi-hit trace from the cameraâ€™s perspective.                                 |
| `SweepFromActorShape`          | Sweeps a shape (sphere, box, or capsule) from an actorâ€™s location.             |
| `TraceGroundBelowActor`        | Traces downward from an actor to detect ground surfaces.                        |
| `TraceCeilingAboveActor`       | Traces upward from an actor to detect ceilings or overheads.                   |
| `GetCameraTraceStartEnd`       | Calculates trace start/end points based on camera type.                         |
| `DrawDebugTraceShape`          | Visualizes shape traces at impact for debugging (sphere, box, capsule).         |
| `GetRandomGroundPointNearby`   | Finds a random surface below a point â€” useful for spawning or AI logic.         |
| `ConeTraceMulti`               | Performs a cone-shaped multi-trace, ideal for vision cones or area scanning.    |
| `TraceFromSocket`              | Traces from a specific socket on a skeletal mesh. Ideal for weapons or effects. |
